irc helper for irc. Identify problems and add solutions for IRC channels/communities.
users get a score based on how they use IRC networks. The scores are mostly bs and just for fun, but a lot of options are available to easily
run and manage your IRC communities.

The script is meant to stop ban evaders and enforce authenticity among the communities.
There are community announcrs to announce things every 24 hours.
There are advance IRC operator popups to manage a network easily

Below is the botmode, when enabled you become a bot (kinda, you can still chat) but the bot mode will allow users to interact with each other with polls, questions, solutions, etc

I'll keep this updated as much as I can.

Made with love, for communities and community leaders,
