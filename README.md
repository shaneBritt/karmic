irc helper for irc. Identify problems and add solutions for IRC channels/communities.
users get a score based on how they use IRC networks.

- The scores are mostly bs and just for fun, but a lot of options are available to easily run and manage your IRC communities.
- The script is meant to stop ban evaders and enforce authenticity among the communities.
- There are community announcrs to announce things every 24 hours.
- There are advance IRC operator popups to manage a network easily

Below is the botmode, when enabled you become a bot (kinda, you can still chat) but the bot mode will allow users to interact with each other with polls, questions, solutions, etc

I'll keep this updated as much as I can.

Made with love, for communities and community leaders,
